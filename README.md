# Automated Text Labeling

I have developed a product using the ChatGPT API. The purpose of this product is to generate a response file based on a researcher's question for any research purpose. This tool allows users to upload a CSV file containing a collection of textual data. Once uploaded, it seamlessly generates labels for all the text entries within the CSV file and presents the results in a convenient CSV format. The product is built using Java, Spring, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and a RESTful API. With this product, my aim is to simplify the text labeling process in Machine Learning for researchers.

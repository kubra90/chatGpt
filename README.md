# Automated Text Labeling

I have developed a product using the ChatGPT API. The purpose of this product is to generate a one word label that summarizes the content. 
This tool enables the uploading of a csv file containing an array of textual data. Once uploaded, it seamlessly generates one-word labels for 
all the text entries within the csv file, presenting the results in a convenient csv format. Built using Java, Spring, Javascript, HTML, CSS, RESTful API.
